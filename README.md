# Perficient
Repository containing the source code of a Flask app which is made for a company Perficient

## Prerequisites
1. Python installed on your PC and updated to PATH
2. Flask framework installed

### To complete the prerequisites
To fulfill first prerequisite, install Python installer and click it. Now, it will show a path. Remember the path(it will be useful). Install Python. Now, go to that path and go to **bin** directory. Copy the path. Search _env_ and click **Edit the system environment variables**. Then, click PATH, click New and paste the path. Now click **OK OK OK**. Make sure to click OK at every step else if you fail, the process has to be redone. After completing first step, open cmd and type **pip install flask** or **py -m pip install flask**, either command will work but the second one is bound to work if PATH variables are configured.

#### To run the source code in your local environment, follow the steps(assuming that prerequisites are present)
1. Download **perficient.7z** and extract it using 7-Zip File Manager
2. Now, the entire directory will be extracted. Go there
3. You will see a Python file along with some HTML files
4. Right-click and Open With Code(if this feature doesn't come to your PC, then open VS Code and directly open folder here)
5. Now, open the **app.py** file. Keep it opened and if you want, you can read an introductory message we put there
6. Now, click **Terminal** and hit **New Terminal**. Wait for it to open up(if it does, you will see the directory path enclosed within angular brackets/<>)
7. Enter the command **python .\app.py** and it should start development server(if it doesn't, run the install command in this terminal again and reopen it, then repeat)
8. Open Chrome and enter **127.0.0.1:5000** and there's your Flask app in a local machine.

### WARNINGS
**1. DON'T DELETE ANY FILE OR ADD ANY EXTRA**
